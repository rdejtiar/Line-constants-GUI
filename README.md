# Line-constants-GUI
A Graphical Interfase to overhead electrical lines impedance calculation developed by Julius Susanto
Data format imposed by the line constants by Julius  script is maintained.
A line for impedance of the first conductor was added ,assuming  Ampers are equal on the three conductors
