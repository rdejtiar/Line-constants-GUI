# Line-constants-GUI
A Graphical Interfase to overhead electrical lines impedance calculation developed by Julius Susanto.
Data format imposed for  the line data  by Julius  script is maintained.
A line for impedance of the first conductor was added ,assuming  Ampers are equal on the three conductors (modulus)
The GUI is developed with PysimpleGUI.
